# Diagonal Difference Challenge

## Overview
The **Diagonal Difference Challenge** is a Python exercise to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of the primary and secondary diagonals of a square matrix.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `diagonalDifference(arr)` that takes a square matrix as input and returns the absolute difference between:
1. The sum of the primary diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
2. The sum of the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).

### Example
```python
Input:
arr = [
    [11, 2, 4],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [10, 8, -12]
]

Output:
15

## Files
- **solution.py**: Contains the implementation of the function.
- **testcase.py**: Includes unit tests to validate the function.

## How to Run
1. Save the `solution.py` and `testcase.py` files in the same directory.
2. Run `testcase.py` to execute the unit tests.
3. Alternatively, execute `solution.py` to test the function interactively.
