# Diagonal Difference Challenge

## Overview
The **Diagonal Difference Challenge** is a Python exercise to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of the primary and secondary diagonals of a square matrix.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `diagonalDifference(arr)` that takes a square matrix as input and returns the absolute difference between:
1. The sum of the primary diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
2. The sum of the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).

### Example
```python
Input:
arr = [
    [11, 2, 4],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [10, 8, -12]
]

Output:
15
