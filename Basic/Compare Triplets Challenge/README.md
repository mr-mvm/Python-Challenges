# Compare Triplets Challenge

## Overview
The **Compare Triplets Challenge** is a Python problem designed to compare two lists of integers. Each list represents scores, and points are awarded based on which score is higher at each index.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `compareTriplets(a, b)` that takes two lists of integers as input:
- `a` represents Alice's scores.
- `b` represents Bob's scores.

The function returns a list of two integers:  
- The first integer is Alice's total score.
- The second integer is Bob's total score.

### Example
```python
Input:
a = [5, 6, 7]
b = [3, 6, 10]

Output:
[1, 1]
