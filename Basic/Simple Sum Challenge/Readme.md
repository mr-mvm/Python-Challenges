# SolveMeFirst Function

## Overview
This repository implements a simple Python function, `solveMeFirst`, to add two integers. It includes a main solution in `solution.py` and a separate testing script in `testcase.py` for verification and validation.

## Files
- `solution.py`: Contains the main implementation of the function.
- `testcase.py`: A testing script using Python's `unittest` module to validate the correctness of the function.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `solveMeFirst(a, b)` that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

### Example
```python
Input: a = 3, b = 7
Output: 10
