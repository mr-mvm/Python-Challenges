# Solve Me First Challenge

## Overview
The **Solve Me First Challenge** is a simple Python exercise to implement a function that adds two integers and returns their sum.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `solveMeFirst(a, b)` that:
1. Accepts two integers `a` and `b`.
2. Returns their sum.

### Example
#### Input
a = 3 b = 5

#### Output
8

#### Explanation
The function calculates the sum of \(3 + 5 = 8\).

## Files
- **solution.py**: Contains the implementation of the function.
- **testcase.py**: Includes unit tests to validate the function.

## How to Run
1. Save the `solution.py` and `testcase.py` files in the same directory.
2. Run `testcase.py` to execute the unit tests.
3. Alternatively, execute `solution.py` to test the function interactively.
