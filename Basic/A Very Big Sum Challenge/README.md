# A Very Big Sum Challenge

## Overview
The **A Very Big Sum Challenge** is a Python exercise to compute the sum of elements in a list of integers. This challenge is particularly useful for working with large numbers and understanding Python's capability to handle big integers.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `aVeryBigSum(ar)` that takes a list of integers as input and returns their sum.

### Example

## Input:
ar = [1000000001, 1000000002, 1000000003, 1000000004, 1000000005]

## Output:
5000000015

## Files
- **solution.py**: Contains the implementation of the function.
- **testcase.py**: Includes unit tests to validate the function.

## How to Run
1. Save the `solution.py` and `testcase.py` files in the same directory.
2. Run `testcase.py` to execute the unit tests.
3. Alternatively, execute `solution.py` to test the function interactively.
```python
