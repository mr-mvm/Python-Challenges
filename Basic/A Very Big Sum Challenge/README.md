# A Very Big Sum Challenge

## Overview
The **A Very Big Sum Challenge** is a Python exercise to compute the sum of elements in a list of integers. This challenge is particularly useful for working with large numbers and understanding Python's capability to handle big integers.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `aVeryBigSum(ar)` that takes a list of integers as input and returns their sum.

### Example
```python
Input:
ar = [1000000001, 1000000002, 1000000003, 1000000004, 1000000005]

Output:
5000000015
