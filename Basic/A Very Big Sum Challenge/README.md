# A Very Big Sum Challenge

## Overview
The **A Very Big Sum Challenge** is a Python exercise designed to compute the sum of elements in a list of integers. This challenge highlights Python's efficiency in handling large numbers and demonstrates basic algorithmic problem-solving.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `aVeryBigSum(ar)` that takes a list of integers as input and returns their sum.

### Example
**Input**:  
`ar = [1000000001, 1000000002, 1000000003, 1000000004, 1000000005]`

**Output**:  
`5000000015`

## Files
- **`solution.py`**: Contains the implementation of the function.
- **`testcase.py`**: Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the function.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the `solution.py` and `testcase.py` files into the same directory.
2. Run the unit tests:
   ```bash
   python testcase.py
