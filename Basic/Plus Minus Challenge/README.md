# Plus Minus Challenge

## Overview
The **Plus Minus Challenge** is a Python exercise to calculate and display the ratios of positive, negative, and zero elements in an array.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `plusMinus(arr)` that:
1. Takes a list of integers `arr`.
2. Calculates:
    - The ratio of positive numbers in the array.
    - The ratio of negative numbers in the array.
    - The ratio of zeros in the array.
3. Prints each ratio on a new line with six decimal places.

### Example
#### Input
`arr = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]`

#### Output
`0.400000`
`0.400000`
`0.200000`

#### Explanation
`Positive ratio: 2/5 = 0.400000`
`Negative ratio: 2/5 = 0.400000`
`Zero ratio: 1/5 = 0.200000`

## Files
- **solution.py**: Contains the implementation of the function.
- **testcase.py**: Includes unit tests to validate the function.

## How to Run
1. Save the `solution.py` and `testcase.py` files in the same directory.
2. Run `testcase.py` to execute the unit tests.
3. Alternatively, execute `solution.py` to test the function interactively.
