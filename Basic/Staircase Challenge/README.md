# Staircase Challenge

## Overview
The **Staircase Challenge** is a Python exercise to generate a right-aligned staircase pattern of height `n`. This challenge helps improve logic-building skills and mastery of loops in Python.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `staircase(n)` that prints a staircase pattern:
1. Each level is represented by `#`.
2. The staircase is right-aligned.
3. The size of the staircase is defined by `n`.

### Example
For `n = 4`:
